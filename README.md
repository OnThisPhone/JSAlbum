## Hello!
This application shows off a little image picker in a classic panel layout.

It can be added just about anywhere that lets you edit HTML/JS/CSS.

## Description:
I made the app load images that had numbers for names because i ultimately felt that the code would be a bit sleeker. But also because in an example like this, you don't have to deal with real names of resources, and how often do you get the chance to do some wacky indexing?

You can click the two sides of the main image to change the image to the next in the "album" (Bottom panels), and it loops if you reach each respective end of the "album".

You can also click the "album" itself to change to that one specifically.

## What you need?:
Nothing. As long as you have a modern browser that has the ability to render from the "file" schema, you should be good to go! Have fun!
